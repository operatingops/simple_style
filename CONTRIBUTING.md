# Contributing

This guide based on the one in [factory_girl_rails v4.8.0][source]. Thanks Thoughtbot!

## Conduct

We'd love for you to contribute, and we want you to be you while you do it. This project follows a few rules that we hope will make contributing a good experience for everyone. These rules are just a framework; they're here to help you understand how the project works. Each contributor is responsible for their conduct.

* Be professional.
* The project's maintainers manage the project. You (hopefully!) contribute. Don't try to manage the project or the people working on it unless a current maintainer specifically asks you to.
* Only use the project to work on the project. Take non-project conversations and activities somewhere else.
* Contribute your own work. If you use someone else's work:
  * Make sure it has a non-viral (e.g. no GNU) license that allows you to use it on this project.
  * Credit them where you use their work (e.g. with a link in a comment).

## Code

1. [Fork and clone the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

1. Create a feature branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my_feature
   ```

1. Make your change.

1. Push to your fork.

   ```shell
   git push origin my_feature
   ```

1. [Create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

To increase the chance that your pull request gets accepted:

* Follow the style guide. ðŸ™‚
* Write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
* Organize your commits. "Fix typo" and "work in progress" commits are hard to follow. If you like to commit often,
  check out git's [rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/). You can use it to clean up at the end.
